<GENERATOR-INSTRUMENT>JWST_NIRSpec-2700: JWST/NIRSpec is the infrared spectrometer onboard the James Webb Space Telescope. The high-resolution configuration (RP~2700) considers the maximum resolving power for each of the available instrument gratings/filters combinations (G140H+F070LP, G140H+F100LP, G235H+F170LP, G395H+F290LP). The three gratings cover the 1.0 to 5.3 um spectral region with an average resolving power of 2700.
