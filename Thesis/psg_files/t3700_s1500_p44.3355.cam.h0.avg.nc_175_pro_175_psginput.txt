<GENERATOR-INSTRUMENT>JWST_MIRI-MRS: JWST/MIRI is the Mid-Infrared Instrument onboard the James Webb Space Telescope. The medium resolution spectroscopy (MRS) configuration covers wavelengths from 5 to 28.3 um, enabled by four Integral Field Units (IFUs) with FOVs of 3.9 to 7.7 (#1: 5 to 7.7 um, #2: 7.7 to 11.9 um, #3: 11.9 to 18.4 um, #4: 18.4 to 28.3 um). This configuration has an effective throughput of 0.3 and an average resolving power of 2400.
